  <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Chess<br>I am an active chess player, playing in local, county and national chess leagues.</li>
    <li>Renewable Energy<br>I am passionate about <strong>Green Energy</strong> and run an Energy company promoting renewable energy solutions such as Solar. I also drive an Electric Car, which neatly links to my next hobby!</li>
    <li>Cars<br>I have been a "Petrolhead" since I was a kid! In addition to the aforementioned Electric Car, I also run a Mazda MX5 for a bit of fun and to let my hair down at the weekends.</li>
    <li>Politics<br>I have been interested in politics since my school days when I studied economics. This has recently expanded to include American politics, where the antics of Donald J Trump have made for interesting viewing!</li>
